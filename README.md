> Obfuscation 混淆  
> In software development, **obfuscation** is the deliberate act of creating source or machine code that is difficult for humans to understand.

Obfuscation is the process of converting programming code to some other form, so it is difficult to perform reverse engineering (Difficult to understand by humans).

**Now a days**, sophisticated Java decompilers are available, which convert Java class files to source code. By using any good decompiler, one can reverse engineer the code, which is a security threat, by using obfuscation, we can make this reverse engineering process hard.

> `Nowadays` or `Now a Days`? `Nowadays` is the only **correct** spelling of this word. Spelling the word as three words—`now a days`—is **incorrect**. `Nowadays` means “**at the present time**.” It’s easy to use, but the spelling gives some people trouble.
